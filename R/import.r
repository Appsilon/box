#' Unload a given module
#'
#' Unset the module name that is being passed as a parameter, and remove the
#' loaded module from cache.
#' @param mod name of the module which should be unloaded
#' @note Any other references to the loaded modules remain unchanged, and will
#' still work. However, subsequently importing the module again will reload its
#' source files, which would not have happened without \code{xyz::unload}.
#' Unloading modules is primarily useful for testing during development, and
#' should not be used in production code.
#'
#' \code{xyz::unload} comes with a few restrictions. It attempts to detach
#' itself if it was previously attached. This only works if it is called in the
#' same scope as the original \code{xyz::use} call, or an inherited scope.
#' @seealso \code{\link{use}}
#' @seealso \code{\link{reload}}
#' @export
